=========================================================================

Functional Arrays provides a set of prototype extensions to Javascript's
Array object that help facilitate functional programming.

The prototype extensions consist of six methods that allow for different
iterations over an Array. Three of the methods will modify the contents
of the Array while the other three methods are non-modifying. 

Any additional arguments passed into the prototype extensions other than
what is specified for them will be passed along to action.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The three modifying methods are apply, apply_range, and apply_index.

apply:
    Applies an action to each element of the Array storing the result
  of action in the element. 

    Array.prototype.apply = function (action)

  example:
    //The following multiplies every element of a by 8.
    function scale (ele, scalingFactor) {
      return ele * scalingFactor;
    }
    var a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    a.apply (scale, 8);


apply_range:
    Applies an action to the elements in the specified range of
  the Array storing the result of action in the element.

    Array.prototype.apply_range = function (begin, end, action)

  example:
    //The following multiplies the second through the last elements of a 
    //by 8.
    function scale (ele, scalingFactor) {
      return ele * scalingFactor;
    }
    var a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    a.apply_range (1, a.length, scale, 8);


apply_index:
    Applies an action to the elements specified in the indices
  array storing the result of action in the element.

    Array.prototype.apply_index = function (indices, action)

  example:
    //The following multiplies the second and the fourth elements of a by
    //8.
    function scale (ele, scalingFactor) {
      return ele * scalingFactor;
    }
    var a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    a.apply_index ([1, 3], scale, 8);


The action method passed into the prototype extension will take the form:

    function action (element) { return res; };


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The three non-modifying methods are for_Each, for_each_range, and
for_each_index.

for_each:
    Runs action for each element of the Array. for_each is similar to
  Javascript's native forEach Array method. It is here for naming
  consistency and to allow extra arguments to be passed to action.

    Array.prototype.for_each = function (action)

  example:
    //The following shows an alert for each element in a.
    function foo (ele) {
      alert (ele);
    }
    var a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    a.for_each (foo);


for_each_range:
    Runs action for each element in the specified range of the
  Array.

    Array.prototype.for_each_range = function (begin, end, action)

  example:
    //The following shows an alert for the second throug hthe last 
    //elements in a.
    function foo (ele) {
      alert (ele);
    }
    var a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    a.for_each_range (1, a.length, foo);


for_each_index:
    runs action for each of the elements specified in the
  indices array.

    Array.prototype.for_each_index = function (indices, action)

  example:
    //The following shows an alert for the second and the fourth
    //elements in a.
    function foo (ele) {
      alert (ele);
    }
    var a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    a.for_eachi_index ([1, 3], foo);


The action method passed into the prototype extension will take the form:

    function action (element) {};


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

sliceArguments:
  provides a slice of the arguments back as an Array. This method is
necessary since the arguments object does not provide a slice operation.

    function sliceArguments (args, begin, end)

  examples:

    //The following will slice all of the arguments into args.
    function foo () {
      var args = sliceArguments (arguments);
    }

    //The following will slice the second through the end of arguments 
    //the into args.
    function foo () {
      var args = sliceArguments (arguments, 1);
    }

    //The following will sloce the second through the fourth arguments
    //into args.
    function foo () {
      var args = sliceArguments (arguments, 1, 3);
    }
